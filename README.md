# Demonstration for Git for Grad 5100

This is the README file for my demonstration of Git to the Grad 5100 class in 
Fall of 2024. 

I regretted that line, so I deleted it and put this one instead. 

On the main branch, I added a different line. 
On the development branch, I added this line. 

I made this change in the cloned copy.
